    "1. It is assumed that the mean systolic blood pressure is `Î¼ = 120 mm Hg`. In the Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of `n = 100` people had an average systolic blood pressure of 130.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 21.21 mm Hg. Is the group significantly different (with respect to systolic blood pressure!) from the regular population?\n",
